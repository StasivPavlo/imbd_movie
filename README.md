# Task

Create a website where you can indicate which movies you've already seen and which ones you want to watch.
to watch. The site uses the open API of IMDB (http://www.omdbapi.com/). The API key that you can use for
this is "186be766". Example: http://www.omdbapi.com/?i=tt3896198&apikey=186be766

Functionality:
- Ability to search by movie title
- You can specify which movie you have already seen
- You can specify which movie you still want to watch
- You can rate the movie you have watched 
- You can save your favorite movies to localstorage
- authorization is required (also localstorage)

You can choose the technologies you want to use for this. The emphasis of the test is more on
on the chosen methodology and neat layout rather than on the number of functionalities.  stack react ts redux matirial-ui
